# Project Overview

I continued testing the app from where the preecious developer left this project. Since Iam new to Jasmin testing. It 
took me loner just to understand the framework first. So I put my knowledge to test. I realised the importance of testing.I certianly have to practice more and more. I will.  


## Why this Project?

Even though the raw code is provided by Udacity, I still had to understand $ajax code first how the testing loads as soon the app loads. From there worked an each task so It really helped me how testing can be usefull through this project. 

## What I learnt?
At first Jasmin was scary. After many days of research, I understood Powerfull testing can me done using simple keywords such as  describe, it, expect, tobe and others and using them in sturture. And I noticed "function"is used for all keywords. 

## How will this help my career?

Testing helps to make app runs without errors or by predicting possible errors and ways to overcome.
